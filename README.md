## Hello, I'm Bartek üëã

**Junior Software Developer** | 4+ Years Stakeholder Communication Experience

After 4+ years helping families make their biggest investment decisions through architectural design, **I started experimenting with programming as a hobby.** After several months of coding projects, I realized I wanted to pursue this path seriously and enrolled in **Computer Science studies at PJATK.**

_Now I'm combining my proven problem-solving and stakeholder communication skills from architecture with software development to build reliable, scalable systems._

**Beyond the code**

I'm passionate about developer tooling and automation. I maintain my own [dotfiles]([link](https://github.com/bartlomiej-milosz/dotfiles.git)) and enjoy writing scripts to streamline workflows. This hands-on approach to tooling helps me understand systems at a deeper level.
