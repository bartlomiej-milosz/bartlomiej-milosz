## Hello, I'm Bartek 👋

**Data Analyst | Computer Science Student @ PJATK Warsaw**

After 4+ years **helping families make their biggest investment decisions** through architectural design, I realized I was spending as much time analyzing data as designing spaces.

_Now combining business consulting experience with technical learning to help organizations make better data-driven decisions._
