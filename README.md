## Hello, I'm Bartek 👋

**Junior Software Developer** | 4+ Years Stakeholder Communication Experience

After 4+ years helping families make their biggest investment decisions through architectural design, **I started experimenting with programming as a hobby.** After several months of coding projects, I realized I wanted to pursue this path seriously and enrolled in **Computer Science studies at PJATK.**

_Now I'm combining my proven problem-solving and stakeholder communication skills from architecture with software development to build reliable, scalable systems._
